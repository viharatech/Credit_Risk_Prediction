# Fraud Analysis on the Customers:

In this Repo , I have done a Project on machine learning classification problem statement Which requires a Huge dataset where I got it from 3rd part websites and don't worry I want to share the dataset with you and you can get it from here:






## Project Overview:

![App Screenshot](https://i0.wp.com/dataaspirant.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/1-Credit-card-fraud-detection-with-classification-algorithms.png?w=750&ssl=1)

Using Pandas library I loaded the dataset and also check the complete information about the dataset using the same library.
since the data is having lot of Null values I am going to take help of statistics concept to clean the data and if my approach was not a good way for doing this Project Please let know.
But while focusing on Missing values I got it know Last 2 rows are completely NAN so I removed the last 2 Rows.

yah After removing last 2 rows the data becomes quite good where only 2 columns having null values and remaining things are solved:


## I am following Machine Learning pipeline for developing this project :

           - PipeLine of Machine Learning Project:
           - Collect the data
           - check the data information
           - split the data
           - training operations should be done on test data [Just Keep in Mind]
           - Handle Missing values if There
           - EDA Part [Exploratory Data Analysis]
           - Checking Normal Distribution
           - Checking Outliers
           - Handling them
           - Handle Cateogorical data
           - Transformation Techniques
           - select best features for both numerical and categorical data
           - Model developement
           - check validation
           - Evaluate model
           - check AUC and ROC For selecting Best Model
           - Hyperparameter tuning on the top of the best model
           - Save the model
           - Read the Model and check once again
           - Using Flask Integrate with HTML and CSS
           - Generate outcome in localhost
           - Deploy in Server
           - API Generation
           - Share our Project API

## why spliting the data:

If we divide the data after feature engineering part the std[standard deviation and variance] will be completely different for both train and test this leads to data leakage, so to overcome this I am splitting the data and applying the operations on train same result saving it for test:


### Handle Missing values:

for Handle Missing values we have used mean median and mode concept where its working really fine and when coming to Outliers I applied a Techniques called std and iqr since it really works fine the worst feature converts into proper feature:

### Before Handling Outliers on of the feature looks like this:

### After handling Outliers using some IQR Techniques the data comes to position called Normal Distribution:

If this looks good you can follow the entire concept which mentioned in the above coading file:

Meanwhile while working with feature engineering part I am taking the help of sklearn and fearture engine frameworks for better EDA and model developement part:

Techniques done using sklearn and feature engine :

              - Variable Transformation
              - Outliers
              - data scaling concepts 

### Since EDA part Feature engineerig part is to high I am not going to explain each line of code here You can check it from the above coding file:

## Feature selcetion:

As mentioned in the above Image there are multiple methods for Analysis of feature selcetion but for My data using sklearn and feature engine I have gone with correlation and filter methods for numerical data since some columns selected as best remaining things I removed from the data: 
using correlation even My threshold value is to high 0.85 but no feature is passing or crossing the threshold value so correlation didn't select best features.
using Hypothesis testing I got best features with p_value < 0.5 concept>

## Finally entire data is set ready for Model developement Purpose:
since the data is not balanced using Upsamping and down sampling concepts I Handle them.

Know I selected KNN , naive bayes , Logistic Regression , Decision Tree and Random Forest for Model developement:

since after training the model I got the results of :

                  - KNN Accuracy : 0.8703838383838384
                  - NB Accuracy  : 0.6992929292929293
                  - LR Accuracy  : 0.7377373737373737
                  - DT Accuracy  : 0.707939393939394
                  - RF Accuracy  : 0.690949494949495
since almost the results are very close to each other I stuck around to select the best model: No worries I am having AUC and ROC concept so I find out FPR and TPR using Grapical represntation and selected best model which is Logistic Regression:

Finally It takes lot of time for Data Analysis and model developement part but following ML pipeline really gives me perfect way for doing an End-to-End peoject:

Entire code and hidden information You can get it from the above coding file:
